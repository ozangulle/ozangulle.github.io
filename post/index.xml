      <description>I bought my first Arduino board a couple of years ago. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take long before I wanted to have some kind of network capability for my board so I bought some ESP8266 01 WiFi modules afterwards. Then I learned that ESP8266s are actually powerful enough to run simple codes. I have an obsession with overhead in my personal projects so I realized that I did not need the Arduino anymore and could ditch it.</description>

      <description>It was about time.
 I created this website back in 2017 when I was fresh out of university. I published a few posts, but most of them were too academical, badly written, and not very interesting to be honest.
 I decided that it was time for a clean-up. I don&amp;#39;t know whether I will ever publish anything here.</description>
